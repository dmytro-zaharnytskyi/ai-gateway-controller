# ai-gateway-controller — Design

Architecture decisions are maintained in the Open Data Hub ADR repository.
The External Model/Praxis two-plane decision is tracked as
[ODH-ADR-MS-0005](https://github.com/opendatahub-io/architecture-decision-records/pull/165),
so this implementation repository does not carry a second authoritative copy.

## Status

**Phase 1:** `make build` (tidy, lint, test, binary) passes clean. Not yet
built into a released image, not yet pushed to a remote, not yet wired
end-to-end into a live `ai-gateway-operator` reconcile (see "Out of scope").

**Phase 2 (EA2):** the multi-tenant Praxis-vs-IPP fan-out and ExternalModel
control plane are implemented. `pkg/tenant` primarily watches
`MaasTenantConfig` — mirroring
maas-controller's own `TenantReconciler` — and, for every tenant whose
`metadata.annotations["maas.opendatahub.io/payload-processing-type"]` is
`"praxis"`, renders, SSA-applies, and (on switch-away or deletion) cleans
up a per-tenant copy of the vendored `praxis-extproc` manifests — replacing
Phase 1's single unconditional global install. `pkg/controller` reconciles
`ExternalModel` / `ExternalProvider` resources into the tenant-local ExtProc
overlay, credential projections, and Envoy-owned provider transport.

## Purpose

### ExternalModel handoff and transport cleanup ownership

`ai-gateway-controller` reads `payload-processing-type` and
`payload-processing-status` only from the tenant-local `MaasTenantConfig`.
It publishes ExternalModel serving state only after the selector is Praxis and
the handoff status is `steady`; the tenant reconciler owns the transition to
`steady` and `cleanup-complete`. An explicit `ipp` selector is a cleanup
request and does not wait for `steady`. A missing configuration is retained
for non-deleting models, while deleting models use controller ownership labels
and the model namespace to complete safe final-model cleanup.

Gateway-local provider `DestinationRule` objects and the route `EnvoyFilter`
carry the model namespace, tenant identifier, and current Gateway name and
namespace. On a Gateway move, the controller applies the new copy first and
removes only the old copy carrying the same tenant identity. Neighboring
tenant and foreign-controller resources are not candidates for deletion.

The pre-PR DestinationRule shape from `origin/main` was
`provider-<provider>` in the Gateway namespace with only
`app.kubernetes.io/managed-by=ai-gateway-controller` and
`inference.opendatahub.io/external-provider=<provider>` labels. It has no
tenant or Gateway identity and is therefore inherently ambiguous in a shared
Gateway namespace. The controller intentionally leaves such an object alone;
an operator must perform a targeted manual migration after identifying its
owner. New controller-owned rules are unambiguous and are cleaned up by the
normal handoff/finalizer path.

If a deleting ExternalModel has no resolvable `MaasTenantConfig`/`AITenant` and
there are sibling models, deletion is conservative: it will not rebuild shared
Praxis serving state without a live, steady tenant handoff. The ExternalModel
finalizer remains until the owning handoff objects are restored or the sibling
models are removed. Final-model deletion can clean controller-owned state
using its namespace and ownership labels. Ambiguous pre-PR resources are never
removed by a label-only sweep.

`ai-gateway-controller` is the AI Gateway control-plane controller. Target
state (3.6): sibling of `maas-controller`, both deployed by
`ai-gateway-operator`:

```
ai-gateway-operator ──deploys──▶ ai-gateway-controller ──reconciles──▶ external models (control plane)
ai-gateway-operator ──deploys──▶ ai-gateway-controller ──installs──▶ praxis-extproc (dataplane)
ai-gateway-operator ──deploys──▶ maas-controller ──installs──▶ maas-api
```

This repo replaces the control-plane half of `payload-processing` (IPP):
watching `ExternalModel` / `ExternalProvider` and generating per-model
configuration. The dataplane half moves to **Praxis** (`praxis-extproc`).

Today `maas-controller` deploys the required infrastructure
(CRDs, Deployments, etc.) and the IPP repo watches `ExternalModel` /
`ExternalProvider`, doing both control-plane reconciliation and the ExtProc
dataplane. 3.5 ships only `maas-controller` + IPP; see
[Deployment architecture](#deployment-architecture).

**Phase 1 (implemented today)** vendors and installs `praxis-extproc`
manifests only.

**Phase 2 (EA2, implemented)** primarily watches `MaasTenantConfig` and, per
opted-in tenant, applies and cleans up its own per-tenant ExtProc resources.
It also watches `ExternalModel` / `ExternalProvider` and publishes dynamic
per-model routing, provider transport, and reference-only credentials.

## Deployment architecture

### Current architecture (3.5)

- **Operator chain:** `DataScienceCluster` (`aigateway.modelsAsAService: Managed`) → ODH/RHOAI operator → AI Gateway Operator → **`maas-controller` only**.
- **`ai-gateway-controller` is not deployed in 3.5.** ExtProc dataplane is **IPP** (`payload-processing`), owned entirely by MaaS.
- **`maas-controller` bootstraps infrastructure** (CRDs, Deployments, gateway policies, etc.).
- **IPP owns both control plane and dataplane for external models:**
  - Watches `ExternalModel` / `ExternalProvider` and reconciles per-model configuration.
  - Runs the ExtProc dataplane (Deployment, EnvoyFilter, plugins ConfigMap).
- **`AITenant` is a MaaS-owned object:**
  - `maas-controller` bootstraps `AITenant/models-as-a-service` on startup.
  - AITenant reconciler drives tenant namespace, `MaasTenantConfig`, maas-api, and gateway-scoped platform resources per tenant.
- **IPP is injected through MaaS tenant reconciliation:**
  - Tenant reconcile deploys `payload-processing` based on the owning `AITenant`.
  - No `AITenant` field to pick dataplane backend — IPP is always what gets installed.

```

- **AI Gateway Operator deploys two sibling controllers:**
  - **`ai-gateway-controller`** — external-model control plane (watch + reconcile `ExternalModel` / `ExternalProvider`) and installs `praxis-extproc` (Praxis dataplane).
  - **`maas-controller`** — MaaS platform (maas-api, gateway policies, subscriptions, telemetry, infrastructure bootstrap).
- **Control-plane / dataplane split (replaces IPP's dual role):**
  - **`ai-gateway-controller`** — deployment and reconciling of external models (per-model config generation, formerly in IPP).
  - **Praxis (`praxis-extproc`)** — ExtProc dataplane only.
- **`MaasTenantConfig` selects the dataplane backend per tenant (EA2 / Phase 2, implemented):**
  - `MaasTenantConfig.metadata.annotations["maas.opendatahub.io/payload-processing-type"] == "ipp"` selects **IPP** (`payload-processing`); absent, empty, or unrecognized values follow the current **Praxis** default (via `ai-gateway-controller`'s `pkg/tenant`). This annotation lives only on `MaasTenantConfig` — it is never mirrored to/from `AITenant` — so both controllers always read the same single source of truth from the same object they both watch.
  - Lets 3.6 support both backends during the Praxis migration, one tenant at a time, with a race-free handoff (see [Approach](#approach)) when a tenant swaps backends.
- **Multi-tenancy works the same way it does today:**
  - `MaasTenantConfig` / `AITenant` fan-out drives per-tenant namespaces, gateway binding, and dataplane install — no change to the tenancy model, only which ExtProc backend is selected.
- **Split of responsibilities:**
  - **`ai-gateway-controller`** — external-model control plane, `praxis-extproc` install, per-tenant Praxis/IPP dataplane selection.
  - **`maas-controller`** — MaaS auth, rate limits, API keys, model refs, subscription/policy concerns under that tenant.
- **Lifecycle toggle (decided):** `ai-gateway-controller` shares
  `AIGateway.spec.modelsAsAService.managementState` with `maas-controller`.
  There is no dedicated `AIGatewaySpec` toggle for this component: when MaaS
  is `Managed`, `ai-gateway-operator` deploys both siblings; when MaaS is
  `Removed`, both tear down (with the same teardown-grace-period window
  `maas-controller` uses, since praxis-extproc may still be serving traffic
  MaaS's own teardown depends on). `ModelsAsAServiceReady` reflects both
  Deployments.

## Approach

`praxis-extproc`'s manifests live in a separate repo, so they need
cross-repo, commit-pinned vendoring (the pattern `ai-gateway-operator` uses
for `maas-controller`). But `praxis-extproc`'s `deploy/overlays/odh` ships
placeholder values (namespace, gateway name, route names, and fixed resource
names) that must be rewritten by whoever installs it — vendor-and-apply
alone isn't enough; a post-render step is required too.

This repo combines both: pinned-commit vendoring into
`config/manifests/praxis-extproc/`, then a lightweight `controller-runtime`
manager (no `opendatahub-operator/v2` dependency) that primarily watches
`MaasTenantConfig` (`pkg/tenant`) — mirroring maas-controller's own
`TenantReconciler`, which watches the same object — and, for every tenant
whose payload-processing annotation is `praxis`, does kustomize build →
placeholder post-render → per-tenant rename/patch → SSA apply into that
tenant's Gateway namespace. Both controllers watching the same primary
object (rather than `ai-gateway-controller` watching `AITenant` while
`maas-controller` watches `MaasTenantConfig`) means a backend-selection
write is a single watch event both sides observe together, with no
cross-object propagation lag between them.

`status.gatewayRef` and `status.phase` still live on `AITenant`, not
`MaasTenantConfig`, so this controller also Gets a tenant's owning `AITenant`
(via the `aitenant-name`/`aitenant-namespace` annotations maas-controller's
own `AITenantReconciler` already stamps onto every AITenant-managed
`MaasTenantConfig`) and gates apply on `status.phase == "Active"` there, so
nothing is applied before maas-controller has actually validated the
Gateway and finished bootstrapping the tenant. Both CRDs are read as
`unstructured.Unstructured` against hardcoded `schema.GroupVersionKind`s
rather than by importing `models-as-a-service/maas-controller`'s Go types:
that module's `go.mod` pulls in `kserve`, `knative`, `KEDA`, `openshift/api`,
and more, none of which this controller needs to keep its own dependency
graph minimal.

A `PraxisCleanupFinalizer` on the `MaasTenantConfig` (not `AITenant`)
guarantees a chance to delete what was applied when a tenant switches away
from `praxis` or the `MaasTenantConfig` is deleted (SSA only ever upserts
the current render set, it never deletes what falls out of it) — mirroring
maas-controller's own `tenant-cleanup` finalizer pattern on the same object.
Putting the finalizer on `MaasTenantConfig` rather than `AITenant` is
deliberate: maas-controller's own `AITenantReconciler.deleteTenantConfig`
already blocks `AITenant` deletion until `MaasTenantConfig` — and therefore
every finalizer on it, including this one — is fully gone, so `AITenant`
deletion ordering falls out of that existing mechanism for free, with no
separate coordination needed. `DeletionTimeout` bounds how long cleanup
retries before force-removing the finalizer without confirming cleanup
succeeded, same as before.

### Payload-processing backend swap handshake

Legacy IPP (maas-controller) and Praxis (this repo) share the same
Gateway-namespace resource names (`payload-processing`,
`payload-pre-processing`, etc.), so switching a tenant's
`payload-processing-type` annotation hands the same names off between two
independent controllers. Without coordination this is racy — see
`maas-controller`'s `tenantreconcile.AnnotationPayloadProcessingStatus`
doc comment for the full state machine this mirrors. In short:

- The status annotation (`maas.opendatahub.io/payload-processing-status`)
  lives only on `MaasTenantConfig` and has three meaningful states:
  - `cleanup-complete`: clear to claim. The party currently selected by
    `payload-processing-type` may CAS-claim and start deploying.
  - `steady`: praxis owns the dataplane and may resume/apply. Legacy must
    wait until praxis switch-off writes `cleanup-complete`.
  - **absent**: legacy steady when legacy is selected (existing tenants are
    assumed to run legacy IPP); blocked when praxis is selected (wait for
    legacy cleanup). Brand-new tenants are seeded with `cleanup-complete`
    at `MaasTenantConfig` creation time so their first deploy is never
    blocked by absent.
- Claiming for praxis (`EnsurePraxisMayDeploy` / `claimPraxisSteady`) writes
  `steady` via an optimistic-concurrency `Update`. Legacy's mirror claim
  deletes the annotation back to absent. Concurrent claims on the same
  `cleanup-complete` value: only one `Update` wins; the other observes
  `Conflict` and re-evaluates.
- Status itself is the durable claim — apply failures after a successful
  claim resume on the next reconcile because status is already `steady`.
- If a tenant namespace's `MaasTenantConfig` (always named `default-tenant`,
  in every tenant namespace) is temporarily missing, the
  ExternalModel reconciler treats selection as unknown: it retains existing
  serving state, does not infer a backend from `AITenant`, and waits for the
  owner to recreate the config. Cleanup is performed only after an explicit
  `ipp` selection (or the established deletion handoff), never merely because
  the selector object disappeared.
- After a full, successful switch-off cleanup (`Reconciler.cleanup`), this
  controller writes `cleanup-complete` (`MarkPayloadProcessingCleanupComplete`)
  so maas-controller may claim to absent and (re)deploy legacy IPP.

### Gateway attachments

`spec.gatewayRefs` ([RHOAIENG-90801](https://redhat.atlassian.net/browse/RHOAIENG-90801))
serves a model through explicitly selected tenant Gateways, including models in
user namespaces and models shared by several tenants
(`pkg/controller/attachment.go`). The contract is the RHOAIENG-90800
compatibility one-pager; this records how it is implemented.

- **Home attachment.** The tenant whose `MaasTenantConfig` is in the model
  namespace serves the model when `gatewayRefs` is omitted or names its
  Gateway, through the existing tenant-local path with unchanged resources,
  identifiers and deletion. A model without `gatewayRefs` in a namespace with no
  `MaasTenantConfig` gets no serving state (`Pending`, `TenantNotResolved`). An
  explicit binding never falls back to another Gateway.
- **Extra attachments** resolve Gateway → owning `AITenant`
  (`status.gatewayRef`) → its `MaasTenantConfig` (`GatewayNotManaged`,
  `AmbiguousTenant`) and are gated per tenant by the handshake above: Praxis and
  `steady`, otherwise `TenantNotSteady` (existing state retained) or
  `TenantNotPraxis`. Status reports the first failing attachment in
  `gatewayRefs` order; per-Gateway status is [RHOAIENG-90802](https://redhat.atlassian.net/browse/RHOAIENG-90802).

Serving a model through another tenant's Gateway follows in the next changes:
until then such an attachment reports `AttachmentPending` and receives no
serving state.

## Scope

### Phase 1 — `praxis-extproc` install (implemented)

- Vendor `deploy/overlays/odh` from `opendatahub-io/praxis-extproc@main` at a
  pinned commit (`hack/scripts/get-manifests.sh`) into
  `config/manifests/praxis-extproc/`, baked into the image via `Dockerfile`.
- `pkg/render`: kustomize build, placeholder post-render (target namespace,
  the `maas-default-gateway` placeholder, `PLACEHOLDER.maas-api-route.N`
  route names, `*.openshift-ingress.svc.cluster.local` FQDNs), and SSA-apply
  with a dedicated field owner (`ai-gateway-controller`). These primitives
  are tenant-agnostic; `pkg/tenant` (Phase 2) is what makes them per-tenant.
- PR/CI conventions — see [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Phase 2 — multi-tenancy + external models (EA2, implemented)

- **Implemented:** `pkg/tenant` primarily watches `MaasTenantConfig`
  (`maas.opendatahub.io/v1alpha1`) — mirroring maas-controller's own
  `TenantReconciler` — and, for every tenant whose
  `maas.opendatahub.io/payload-processing-type` annotation is absent or `praxis`,
  renders and applies a dedicated, per-tenant-named copy of the
  praxis-extproc resources (`{base}-{tenantID}`, the default/legacy tenant
  keeps the unsuffixed names) into that tenant's owning `AITenant`'s
  `status.gatewayRef` namespace, once that `AITenant`'s `status.phase` is
  `Active`. A secondary `AITenant` watch reacts to gatewayRef/phase changes
  that a `MaasTenantConfig`-only watch would miss. Tenants explicitly set to
  `ipp` are untouched — `maas-controller`'s own
  `TenantReconciler` owns their IPP deployment. The current product default is
  Praxis when the selector is absent; explicit `ipp` is the opt-out.
  `PraxisCleanupFinalizer` (on `MaasTenantConfig`) deletes a tenant's
  praxis-extproc resources when it switches away from `praxis` or its
  `MaasTenantConfig` is deleted; `--deletion-timeout` bounds how long that
  retries before force-removing the finalizer without confirmed cleanup.
  This controller does not write any `AITenant` at all (status or
  otherwise) — maas-controller's own `AITenant` reconciler owns it today.
- `pkg/controller` watches `ExternalModel` / `ExternalProvider` and publishes
  the content-addressed overlay, provider routes and transport, and Secret
  references. Tenant-local ExtProc runs `intelligent_route` and
  `credential_inject`; Envoy performs route reselection and the provider hop.

### Out of scope (explicitly deferred)
- Watching `AIGateway` (or any CR) from this controller. Lifecycle is
  owned by `ai-gateway-operator` via the shared
  `ModelsAsAService.ManagementState` toggle (see [3.6 architecture](#36-architecture-target));
  this controller only needs its `MaasTenantConfig` and `AITenant` watches.
- End-to-end verification of the `ai-gateway-operator` wiring described in
  [Repo layout](#repo-layout) (RBAC sufficiency, image-param injection,
  deploy/teardown alongside `maas-controller` under the shared MaaS toggle).
  `ai-gateway-operator` already vendors this repo's `config/self` (no
  `exclude_path` needed) and appends it when
  `ModelsAsAService.ManagementState == Managed` in
  `internal/controller/aigateway/aigateway.go`; a real vendoring/deploy run
  from this repo's side has not been confirmed yet.

## Inference API schema extension

[RHOAIENG-90800](https://redhat.atlassian.net/browse/RHOAIENG-90800) is a bounded,
additive extension to ODH-ADR-MS-0005's frozen migration baseline. AGC's
`api/inference/v1alpha1` types and generated `config/crd/bases` schemas source
the new fields. Retain the ADR's local API mirrors and CI drift checks;
MaaS installs the inference CRDs, and operator manifest pins propagate them.
AGC, MaaS and API owners agreed this extension separately from the migration
baseline.

`spec.gatewayRefs` is optional, with 1–16 unique namespace/name pairs when
present. Omission retains tenant-local resolution without a global default.
`status.gateways` uses the same full identity, optional `httpRouteRef`
name/namespace, and conditions keyed by type whose `observedGeneration`
refers to the model generation. Ready attests reconciliation/distribution;
aggregate Ready requires every requested attachment. `httpRouteName` remains
the legacy alias, populated for a single attachment only when its route is
in the model namespace. Other existing status fields remain available.

An omitted provider-reference namespace means the model namespace. Inherited
auth uses the provider-local Secret; an override uses the model-local Secret.
Secret references remain name-only. Preserve the installed schema's accepted
names and `auth.type: simple`; schema acceptance does not add auth behavior.
The schema compatibility test pins the legacy MaaS validation baseline.
Until cross-namespace authorization is implemented, the resolver skips a
provider reference to another namespace and never substitutes a local provider.

Schema installation alone does not enable serving these fields. Attachment
ownership, status publication, provider authorization/credential delivery,
and MaaS selection belong to the follow-up stories. Activation requires
aligned packaged schemas and serving implementations, verified tenant
cleanup/claim ownership (including shared models/providers), and the serving,
status, MaaS and installed-package checks.

## Dependencies

No cross-repo Go type imports (no dependency on `ai-gateway-operator/api/...`
or `models-as-a-service/...`): `pkg/tenant` watches `MaasTenantConfig` and
`AITenant` via `unstructured.Unstructured` + hardcoded
`schema.GroupVersionKind`s instead (see "Approach"). `ExternalModel` /
`ExternalProvider` watches, if they need
typed access to CRDs this repo doesn't already define, should default to the
same pattern unless a concrete need for generated deepcopy/defaulting
justifies revisiting it. Today only:

- `sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime` (client + manager, leader election, health
  endpoints)
- `sigs.k8s.io/kustomize/api` (`krusty`) for kustomize build
- Standard `k8s.io/api`, `k8s.io/apimachinery`, `k8s.io/client-go`

## Tooling & conventions

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for what CI enforces. A few
decisions worth calling out here because they're not obvious from the config
alone:

- Arithmetic safety (overflow/underflow, unsafe numeric casts) is a
  code-review responsibility, not a lint — there is no mature Go tool for
  this.
- `go fix` modernizer suggestions are report-only (`make modernize`), not a
  CI gate.
- KAL (`kube-api-linter`) and `crdify` are not adopted — both only apply once
  this repo defines its own CRD types, which it doesn't today.
- Image publishing goes through Konflux (`.tekton/` PipelineRuns), not a
  GitHub Actions release workflow.

## Open questions (non-blocking, tracked)

- `pkg/tenant.Reconciler` does not write any status
  (condition/phase) on `MaasTenantConfig` or `AITenant` reflecting whether
  the per-tenant praxis-extproc install succeeded — maas-controller's own
  reconcilers own `status` on both objects today, so this would need a
  careful merge strategy, not a blind `Status().Update()`.
- A computed per-tenant resource name over 63 characters (possible even
  within the CRD's 41-character `AITenant` name limit, since that limit
  was sized against maas-controller's own longest base name, not
  praxis-extproc's longer `payload-processing-plugins`) is logged and
  skipped rather than retried; revisit if this needs surfacing more
  visibly (event, status, metric) once status is written.
- Whether `payload-processing-reader`'s RBAC needs to grow once more Praxis
  filters land (today's rules cover exactly the `request_id` /
  `model_to_header` filter chains in use).
- `Params.MaaSAPIRouteName`'s fidelity is unverified against a live
  maas-api `HTTPRoute` — revisit once this controller integrates with one.
- End-to-end verification of the `ai-gateway-operator` wiring described in
  "Out of scope" (RBAC sufficiency, shared-MaaS-toggle deploy/teardown).
- This repo has no git remote yet, so none of `.github/workflows/*` have
  actually executed — they're believed correct against the Makefile targets
  but unverified in GitHub Actions.
